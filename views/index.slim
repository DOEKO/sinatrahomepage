              | IÂ´m a freelance web developer for front end from Berlin. Actually I studied scandinavian studies and economies. After that I started a career as an accounting manager but decided to change my profession because I newly discovered my passion for coding. I've always been fascinated by games and how they were built and I am still a little gamer. The freedom of beeing creative while working cannot be compared with any other job I did before. I'm very faszinated about development and love to code and build new things.
            p Besides coding I dedicated my life to travel and music - the love of my life. I love exploring new cultures and learning new languages. Also am I a passionate singer and absolute karaoke enthusiast.
